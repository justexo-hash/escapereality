# Weird Core Website

A basic website attempting to capture the Weird Core aesthetic.

## Setup

1.  Place the HTML (`index.html`), CSS (`style.css`), and image files in the same directory.
2.  Make sure the images referenced in `index.html` exist:
    *   `weirdcore1.jpg`
    *   `weirdcore2.jpg`
    *   `weirdcore3.jpg`
3.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Description

This site uses:

*   Basic HTML structure.
*   CSS for styling, aiming for a nostalgic, slightly jarring look:
    *   "Amateur" fonts (Comic Sans MS fallback).
    *   Bright, primary, and contrasting colors.
    *   Simple, somewhat blocky layout with borders.
    *   Incorporation of Weird Core imagery and text motifs.

## Further Development Ideas

*   Add a weird/pixelated background image or repeating pattern.
*   Incorporate animated GIFs (sparkles, eyes, glitches).
*   Use more specific pixel fonts.
*   Add CSS animations (like blinking text).
*   Introduce more layout distortions or asymmetries.
*   Consider adding simple JavaScript for interactive weirdness (e.g., elements following the cursor, random text changes).
